This might actually be useful for examining the specific parts of input sequences that influence chromatin patterns we observe\n","- highway: allows bits of information to flow between layers, uses gating (? not sure what this means yet) \n","- sigmoid: classifies the final outputs as bound and unbound. The outputs here are binary\n","\n","I'm not concerned about if something is bound, what I want to know is if we can see sequence features that are distinct between groups, without having to perform motif analysis. Since a lot of our target sites don't even contain consensus motifs, it's not really very interesting to classify the 'if' part, but the 'why' part is interesting.\n","\n","The deopen framework is interesting and has been used to classify chromatin accessibility for non-coding sequences. This is more similar to what I'm trying to do.\n","\n","DeepCAGE might be the most relevant. It combines a lot of different information, but the idea is that is a deeply connected CNN (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672022922000249?via%3Dihub)\n","It uses 3 deep layers to classify the sequences, but I don't need to make sequence classifications, I can use k-means to classify my sequences and then annotate sequences with their clusters and ask the CNN to consider if there are discernable sequence feautures underlying the classes\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3Y3WoR1h2_fV"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"id":"xv8XR_OBdF4T","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1659218991913,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":158,"user":{"displayName":"Orion Banks","userId":"07916794667764550459"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import tensorflow as tf"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"id":"39jVoqq9JhxA","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1659219458547,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":164,"user":{"displayName":"Orion Banks","userId":"07916794667764550459"}},"outputId":"a1f68291-d766-4068-9366-9230c314e75e"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-19-43225029818d>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      1\u001b[0m \u001b[0minput_shape\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m8\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m8\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m2\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 2\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mcvl\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mtf\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mkeras\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mlayers\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mConv2D\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m4\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m2\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mactivation\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'relu'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0minput_shape\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0minput_shape\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mfplots\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mcvl\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mshape\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'fplots' is not defined"]}]}]}
